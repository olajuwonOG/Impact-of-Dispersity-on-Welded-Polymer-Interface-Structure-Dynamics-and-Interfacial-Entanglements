# Impact-of-Dispersity-on-Welded-Polymer-Interface-Structure-Dynamics-and-Interfacial-Entanglements
Lammps Input script and analysis script for impact of chain length dispersity on adhesion dynamics


◦ density_profile.py – Python code to calculate density profile for single film

◦ bacf.py – Python script to calculate the bond vector autocorrelation at the free surface and center of the single film

◦ diffusion.in – LAMMPS input script for performing thermal welding - adhesion

◦ chain_ends.py – distribution of chain ends calculation for the welded polymer interface

◦ concentration_profile_two_films.py – calculates the concentration profile for the interdiffusing chains

◦ areal_density.py – calculates the areal density of topological constraints (TCs), density of TCs for interface and bulk when welded


*** We use the Z1+ code to calculate entanglement properties (interface and bulk) - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465522002867
